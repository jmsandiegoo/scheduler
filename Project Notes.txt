# Rules
-
> very 24hr must have at least 7 hours of consistent break (CONSISTENT BREAK) 

> Total 12 hrs of work and 12 hours of rest in a day (TOTAL BREAK)

> (*So the 12hr mandatory break must have a 6hr continuous break) 

> After 3hr sentry... Cannot prowl immediately... Must rest for at least 30mins... Example 5pm to 8pm sentry then cannot prowl immediately at 8pm... Can only prowl at 8:30pm

# Ideas
-
> Use an array with all the shifts inside (sentry and prowl)
